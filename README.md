ROS Navigation Stack for Two-Wheeled Bot
This repository contains a ROS (Robot Operating System) navigation stack implementation for a two-wheeled robot. The navigation stack enables the robot to autonomously navigate its environment using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques and path planning algorithms.

Contents
motion_plan folder:

pid_finsl.py: This Python script implements a PID controller for the bot to center itself between two walls if needed. It assists in maintaining a desired position within the environment.
gmap.launch: Launch file for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) using the Gmapping package. This launches the necessary nodes to perform mapping of the environment.
nav_bot_stack folder:

Contains the main navigation stack for the two-wheeled bot.
Utilizes the AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization) package for localization.
Uses the move_base package for path planning and navigation.
Config folder includes various parameter files for configuring costmaps, local costmaps, and other parameters required for navigation.
Installation
Clone this repository into your ROS workspace:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
Build your ROS workspace:

bash
Copy code
cd your_workspace
catkin_make
Usage
Launch the SLAM node to start mapping the environment:

Copy code
roslaunch motion_plan gmap.launch
Launch the navigation stack for autonomous navigation. Ensure that the map generated by Gmapping is available:

go
Copy code
roslaunch nav_bot_stack nav_stack.launch map_file:=/path/to/your/map.yaml
Use RViz or other visualization tools to monitor the robot's navigation process and view the generated map.
